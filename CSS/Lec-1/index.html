        Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, which is now in Pune district. Scholars
        disagree on his date of birth; the Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating
        Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti). Shivaji was named after a local deity, the goddess Shivai Devi.Shivaji
        belonged to a Maratha family of the Bhonsle clan.Shivaji's father, Shahaji Bhonsle, was a Maratha general who
        served the Deccan Sultanates.His mother was Jijabai, the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, a
        Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.His paternal grandfather Maloji
        (1552â€“1597) was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was
        given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, Chakan, and Indapur to provide for military expenses. He was also given
        Fort Shivneri for his family's residence (1590).At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared
        by three Islamic sultanates: Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the
        Nizamshahi of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune
        and his small army.
